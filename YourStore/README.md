This was an attempt to create a mockup of the display used in the AppStore. 

I cloned <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/4680/how-to-make-an-interface-with-horizontal-tables-like-the-pulse-news-app-part-1">Ray Wenderlichs tutorial</a>

I then made my own changes to it and made the cells "snap" into position. 

clone this repo and open the project in Xcode. Run it on any iOS device.
